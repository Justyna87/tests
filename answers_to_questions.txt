3.a. python module is a set of various functions, collection of various codes that can be imported to the python application.Python package in contrary is a collection of different modules

3.b.Side effects happens when the value of a mutable (global) object, that is passed as argument and is changed within the function (locally),  automatically changes the value of a global object, as it has the same location in the memory. e.g:
x = [1, 2]
print(id(x), x)  # results in [1,2]

def func(x):
    x[1]=4
    print(id(x), x) #results in [1,4]

func(x)    
print(id(x), x) #results in [1,4] 


3.c. Exceptions are errors that happen during execution of a program. You can use try - except block

3.d. Try- except block can be used to create, throw and catch the exception

3.e. Benefits of testing: better quality of code, that saves the cost on long term, less failure an thus better customer experience
